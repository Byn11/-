# PyDracula - Modern GUI PySide6 / PyQt6
 
## This project aims to improve the efficiency of practical work. At present, there are three modules: capacity monitoring Excel generation, batch printing, and keyword search result Excel generation. Due to the project team requiring some confidential files for program input, the current code cannot be used directly. If you want to use it, please download the complete version from the project team's cloud drive

> ## This project is based on modifications made by PyDracula. The author's Github for PyDracula is as follows.
> https://github.com/Wanderson-Magalhaes/Modern_GUI_PyDracula_PySide6_or_PyQt6

> **Warning**: this project was created using PySide6 and Python 3.9, using previous versions can cause compatibility problems.

# High DPI
> Qt Widgets is an old technology and does not have a good support for high DPI settings, making these images look distorted when your system has DPI applied above 100%.
You can minimize this problem using a workaround by applying this code below in "main.py" just below the import of the Qt modules.
```python
# ADJUST QT FONT DPI FOR HIGHT SCALE
# ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
from modules import *
from widgets import *
os.environ["QT_FONT_DPI"] = "96"
```

# Running
> Inside your preferred terminal run the commands below depending on your system, remembering before installing Python 3.9> and PySide6 "pip install PySide6".
> ## **Windows**:
```console
python main.py
```
> ## **MacOS and Linux**:
```console
python3 main.py
```
# Compiling
> ## **Windows**:
```console
python setup.py build
```

# Project Files And Folders
> **main.py**: application initialization file.

> **main.ui**: Qt Designer project.

> **resouces.qrc**: Qt Designer resoucers, add here your resources using Qt Designer. Use version 6 >

> **setup.py**: cx-Freeze setup to compile your application (configured for Windows).

> **themes/**: add here your themes (.qss).

> **modules/**: module for running PyDracula GUI.

> **modules/app_funtions.py**: add your application's functions here.
Up
> **modules/app_settings.py**: global variables to configure user interface.

> **modules/resources_rc.py**: "resource.qrc" file compiled for python using the command: ```pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py```.

> **modules/ui_functions.py**: add here only functions related to the user interface / GUI.

> **modules/ui_main.py**: file related to the user interface exported by Qt Designer. You can compile it manually using the command: ```pyside6-uic main.ui> ui_main.py ```.
After expoting in .py and change the line "import resources_rc" to "from. Resoucers_rc import *" to use as a module.

> **images/**: put all your images and icons here before converting to Python (resources_re.py) ```pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py```.

> **logic.py**: The generation logic of all files for capacity monitoring.

> **connection.py**: Responsible for connecting front-end pages and back-end logic.

> **batch_print.py**:Module for printing all files in a folder together.
